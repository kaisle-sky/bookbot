# bookbot

Bookbot is my first git project. Features include:
- Reports word count for a local txt file
- Reports letter counts for a local txt file

Notesfor future projects/upates:
- Update how the program opens the txt file to follow absolute path
- Investigate other, more useufl features
  - Count occurance of words
  - Use Google trends data to determine the influence of the text on language (ex. release of Frankenstein's impact on word X)
